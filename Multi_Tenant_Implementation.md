# Multi-Tenant Owner Self-Registration Implementation

## Overview
The RMS system now supports multi-tenant architecture where owners can register themselves independently and have complete data isolation through unique tenant IDs.

## Key Features

### 1. Owner Self-Registration
- **Endpoint**: `POST /owner/self-register`
- **Frontend URL**: `/register?type=owner`
- **Multi-Step Form**: 4 steps for better user experience

#### Step 1: Personal Information
- **Required Fields**:
  - Full Name
  - Phone Number
  - Aadhar Number (12 digits, validated)
- **Optional Fields**:
  - Alternate Phone Number
  - PAN Number (format validated)

#### Step 2: Address Details  
- **Required Fields**:
  - Complete Address
  - City
  - State
  - Pincode (6 digits, validated)

#### Step 3: Business Information (Optional)
- **Optional Fields**:
  - Company Name
  - Business Type (Individual/Company/Partnership/LLP)
  - GST Number (format validated)
  - Bank Account Number
  - IFSC Code
  - Bank Name

#### Step 4: Account Setup
- **Required Fields**:
  - Email (unique)
  - Password (minimum 6 characters)

### 2. Automatic Tenant ID Generation
- Each owner receives a unique `tenant_id` during registration
- Format: `tenant_<timestamp>_<random_string>`
- Stored in OwnerMaster model and JWT token

### 3. Data Isolation
All owner-related data is filtered by `tenant_id`:
- ClientMaster records
- PropertyMaster records  
- RentMaster records
- RentTransaction records

### 4. Authentication Flow

#### Owner Registration
1. Owner visits `/register?type=owner`
2. Fills enhanced registration form
3. System auto-generates `tenant_id`
4. Owner data saved to OwnerMasterModel
5. JWT token includes `tenant_id`
6. Auto-login to dashboard

#### Owner Login
- **Frontend**: Admin login page with "Owner" selected
- **Backend**: Multi-role login endpoint checks OwnerMaster model
- **Token**: Includes `tenant_id` for data filtering

### 5. Multi-Role Login Support
The system now supports three user types:
- **SuperAdmin**: No tenant restrictions (userModel)
- **Owner**: Tenant-filtered data (OwnerMasterModel)  
- **Client**: Tenant-filtered data (ClientMasterModel)

## Technical Implementation

### Models Updated
- ✅ OwnerMasterModel: Added `tenant_id`, enhanced fields
- ✅ ClientMasterModel: Added `tenant_id` field
- ✅ PropertyMasterModel: Added `tenant_id` field
- ✅ RentMasterModel: Added `tenant_id` field
- ✅ RentTransactionModel: Added `tenant_id` field

### Routes Updated
- ✅ `/owner/self-register`: New owner registration
- ✅ `/login`: Multi-role authentication
- ✅ `/clientmaster/*`: Tenant-filtered operations
- ✅ Authentication middleware: Tenant ID support

### Frontend Updated  
- ✅ AdminRegister: Query parameter support (`?type=owner`)
- ✅ AdminLogin: Owner/Client signup links with type parameter
- ✅ Enhanced form fields for owner registration

## Usage Examples

### Owner Registration
```javascript
// Frontend navigation
navigate('/register?type=owner')

// Backend request (after completing all 4 steps)
POST /owner/self-register
{
  // Personal Information
  "name": "John Doe",
  "phone": "9876543210",
  "alternatePhone": "9876543211", // optional
  "aadharNumber": "123456789012",
  "panNumber": "ABCDE1234F", // optional
  
  // Address Information
  "address": "123 Main Street, Sector 1",
  "city": "Mumbai",
  "state": "Maharashtra", 
  "pincode": "400001",
  
  // Business Information (optional)
  "companyName": "Doe Properties",
  "businessType": "Company",
  "gstNumber": "27ABCDE1234F1Z5",
  "bankAccountNumber": "1234567890",
  "ifscCode": "HDFC0000123",
  "bankName": "HDFC Bank",
  
  // Authentication
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

### Owner Login
```javascript
// Same login form, backend detects user type
POST /login
{
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}

// Response includes tenant_id
{
  "user": {...},
  "token": "...",
  "tenant_id": "tenant_1234567890_abc123"
}
```

### Data Filtering
```javascript
// All owner operations automatically filtered
GET /clientmaster
// Returns only clients belonging to owner's tenant_id

POST /clientmaster
// Automatically adds owner's tenant_id to new client
```

## Security Features
- ✅ Complete data isolation between tenants
- ✅ Tenant ID validation in middleware
- ✅ Role-based access control maintained
- ✅ SuperAdmin retains full system access

## Migration Notes
- Existing SuperAdmin functionality unchanged
- No UI changes required for existing features
- Backward compatible with current authentication
- New installations get multi-tenant by default

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. Owner Registration
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/register?type=owner`
2. Fill out the enhanced registration form
3. Verify auto-login to dashboard
4. Check localStorage for tenant_id

### 2. Data Isolation
1. Register as Owner A and create clients
2. Register as Owner B and create clients  
3. Verify each owner only sees their own clients
4. Login as SuperAdmin to see all data

### 3. Authentication Flow
1. Test owner login with registered credentials
2. Verify JWT token contains tenant_id
3. Test client login (if clients have passwords)
4. Verify all API calls respect tenant filtering
